# Adeela's interactive map modal

This project is meant for displaying an interactive map that showcases Adeela's activities in different areas around the country

## Approach

- The three years 2019, 2020, and 2021 represent the timeline for the interactive map
- Each year represents a different map where events took place in different places
- A modal pops up when a year in the timeline is selected
- The modal contains a map of the country where areas with events are marked differently
- One option is to use an interactive map API using a library like vectormap or leaflet
- Another way is to use a static map with interactive pins or buttons right on the places of events
- The interactive parts of the map opens another modal that contains details along with a carousel with pictures from the events

## Framework

React js
